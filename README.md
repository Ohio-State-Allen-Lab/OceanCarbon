# OceanCarbon
Data for ocean carbon research
Key words used in file naming for reference:
prot = protein
lip = lipid
carbon w zoo = carbon calculations done with map zooplankton parameter (rather than constant value)
theta = fractional surface coverage (from modified Langmuir isotherm)
For the final carbon model data, both the normalized and unnormalized model outputs are provided, but users should note that the normalization is to the highest value across all months (for easier comparison of all or some months at once).
